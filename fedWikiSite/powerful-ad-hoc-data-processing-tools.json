            "text": " [[Microsoft Access]] does not provide a smooth transition between its mousing-world to its scripting world. Although [[Ex Base]] tends to be keyboard-centric, this is a good thing when you need scripting. MS just tossed their generic VBA engine into the product. VBA is not a [[Domain Specific Language]], unlike [[Ex Base]]'s where the domain is data-diddling. VBA requires filtering stuff through its verbose and unintuitive API's. I agree that with Access one can do an awful lot via point-and-click, but when you hit the limit of the point-and-click world, you hit it hard ([[Discontinuity Spike]]).  As far as SAS is concerned, do you have any specific scenarios you would like to demonstrate?",

While it's true that VBA is not a [[Domain Specific Language]], even despite the slightly more awkward access to database facilities it is every bit as capable as [[Ex Base]] if not much more so.  Despite the die-hards who cling to [[Ex Base]], there's a reason [[Microsoft Access]] dominated (and continues to dominate) the market segment where [[Ex Base]] once held sway -- it's because [[Microsoft Access]] is superior to any [[Ex Base]] implementation in virtually every respect.  SAS, on the other hand, is like SQL on steriods -- though that doesn't capture the power of SAS to extract and report interesting statistics from data sources and recombine them as needed on an ad-hoc basis.  It's designed for that purpose; [[Ex Base]] and SQL aren't.</i>",

Access dominates because its easy to get a lot done via mere point-and-click by IT generalists, and because it's bundled with MS-Office-Pro. I will agree, though, that both could be made better by borrowing ideas from each other. For example, Access could learn from the tight integration/embedding of the query language to the app language and table-driven configuation (instead of proprietary binary blobs); and [[Ex Base]] could use better GUI & mousing tie-ins and a better relationship with SQL/ODBC data sources.",
