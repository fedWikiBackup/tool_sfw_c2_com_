I think [[Servant Attitude]] may be closely related to [[Customer Orientation]], which is vitally important in business. And a [[Servant Attitude]] <i>does not necessarily</i> guarantee the freedom of implementation I describe above. (The key is to have the right Master to get your freedom, but I said I wouldn't say anymore... :-) Actually, there is an analog to this in business, called [[Choosing Your Customers]].)",

If they were (and adjusted things) you would notice chaos and an extension would be added to prevent it.
