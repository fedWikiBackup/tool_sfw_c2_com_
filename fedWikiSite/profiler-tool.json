Since it is infinite (or very long running), you only need to interrupt it once, and you know the problem is on the stack. Just single-step until you get to it, and you'll see the problem. You're not measuring the amount of time anything takes for the purpose of narrowing down where it is. The simple fact that it takes time is what exposes it, down to the exact line and instruction. OK, an infinite loop is a \"bottleneck\" that is active 100% of the time, so a single sample is guaranteed to hit it. Pick a percent - any bottleneck has to have a percent. That is the chance that any single pause will show it. The strategy is, take samples of the call stack until something you can fix shows up on 2 samples, the reason being that if something shows up on only 1 sample, that doesn't mean anything (unless you know a-priori that there's a big bottleneck). What's more, when you pause it, you can not only see where the PC is (or if it's in I/O), you can see the entire \"why-chain\" of why it's there. A \"bottleneck\" can be defined as unnecessary work, and the only way you know it's unnecessary is if you know why it's doing it, which is what the stack sample (and other state info) tells you.",

In real big software, this can find mid-stack calls that account for significant time. That's good. What it doesn't tell you is the reason why that call is being executed. That info is encoded in each sample, but it doesn't let you see the raw samples, so you're left doing some guesswork.",

Since it is infinite (or very long running), you only need to interrupt it once, and you know the problem is on the stack. Just single-step until you get to it, and you'll see the problem. You're not measuring the amount of time anything takes for the purpose of narrowing down where it is. The simple fact that it takes time is what exposes it, down to the exact line and instruction. OK, an infinite loop is a \"bottleneck\" that is active 100% of the time, so a single sample is guaranteed to hit it. Pick a percent - any bottleneck has to have a percent. That is the chance that any single pause will show it. The strategy is, take samples of the call stack until something you can fix shows up on 2 samples, the reason being that if something shows up on only 1 sample, that doesn't mean anything (unless you know a-priori that there's a big bottleneck). What's more, when you pause it, you can not only see where the PC is (or if it's in I/O), you can see the entire \"why-chain\" of why it's there. A \"bottleneck\" can be defined as unnecessary work, and the only way you know it's unnecessary is if you know why it's doing it, which is what the stack sample (and other state info) tells you.",

In real big software, this can find mid-stack calls that account for significant time. That's good. What it doesn't tell you is the reason why that call is being executed.
