Maybe a screen can flash goatse if you do the iffy things, but then you don't know which finger is the baddy. Or light up the problem key. But if you can light up the problem key, then you might as well light up just the chord keys to know what to focus on and skip the baddy calculations altogether.

Computer-aided creativity is non-trivial, and is a barely-explored area ripe for research and development.  Software-wise, we're tolerably good at creating tools to express human creativity (like graphics packages, music composition packages, soft synths, etc.)  We've barely touched on tools that augment human creativity, let alone act as a partner in the creative process.</i>",

This way you can make a judgement call on whether you want to leave the note or give an intentional deviation for effect. But, that's hardware diddling, and I'm a software guy. Maybe a screen can flash goatse if you do the iffy things, but then you don't know which finger is the baddy. Or light up the problem key. But if you can light up the problem key, then you might as well light up just the chord keys to know what to focus on and skip the baddy calculations altogether. The ideal would be a tactile notice (above) so that you don't have to watch screens or lights.  -t",

Fellow lecturers, however, are often obsessed with it.  Students consider Twitter and Facebook to be for \"old\" people because it's what their parents and teachers use, though Facebook messenger is still quite popular amongst youth due to a perceived lack of equivalently-capable alternatives.</i>",
