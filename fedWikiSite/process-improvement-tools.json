For example, a few years back, a Mars lander was lost because part of the system used miles per hour and another part used kilometers per hour.

Lines of code and function points are too fine a level of detail while executable programs and releases are too large.  \"Ideas\" also seem to have a higher level of persistence, as we are able to define them well before any lines of code are written or modified and can still identify them well after a particular release is forgotten.

For example, a few years back, a Mars lander was lost because part of the system used miles per hour and another part used kilometers per hour.
